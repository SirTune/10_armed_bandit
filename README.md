Set of 2000 randomly generated n-armed bandit problems with n=10. 
For each problem, action values Q* (a),a=1,â€¦,10, selected according to the normal (Gaussian distribution) with mean = 0 and variance = 1.
Learning method applied to problem selected action A_t, at time step t, actual reward R_t, was selected from a normal distribution with mean Q* (A_t) and variance = 1. 
learning method, we measure its performance and behaviour as it improves with experience over 100 time steps, when applied to one bandit problem, 1 run.
Repeated over 2000 independent runs, each with a different bandit problem, we obtained measures of the learning algorithms behaviour.
